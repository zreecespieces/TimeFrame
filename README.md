<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Timeframe has a bit of history behind it. It starts with this Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/5g1qzg/request_how_long_would_this_movie_actually_be/dap1h76/</p>
<p>After that post went viral, many people started submitting questions with the same premise, but different movies. So many people in fact, that the subreddit had to ban those type of questions. That's when I realized that someone could just make a calculator for that, and so over the course of the last year, with a lot of hard work, trial-and-error, and persistence, that's what I've done.</p>

<p>This web application utilizes the Open Movie Database API to grab the lengths of movies, and the Internet Movie Script Database to find how many times a certain word is said in that movie, and then crunches the numbers.</p>
<h4>Known Issues:</h4>
<p>If at first after you press submit nothing happens, go to http://www.imsdb.com/ and see if they have all the movies you're trying to search, as it is the smaller of the two databases and so will be the limiting factor.</p>

<p>Titles with spaces in them need to be substituted with hyphens.</p>
