# Container

It is exactly what you would imagine it to be.

```jsx
<Container>
  { /* Children elements */ }
</Container>
```

## Attributes

**className**

This is pretty much what you expect and allows you to add any extra classes to the element.

**fluid**

Takes a boolean to make the container a fluid container or not. Defaults to false, so `.container` will be used. If true, class becomes `.container-fluid`
