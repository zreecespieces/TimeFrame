# Bootstrap grid with ReactJS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iamphill/ReactGrid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iamphill/ReactGrid)

ReactJS is possibly the greatest to happen to the DOM in many years & Bootstrap is possibly the best front-end framework on the web.

There is [React Bootstrap](http://react-bootstrap.github.io/) but it doesn't have the greatest part of Bootstrap - the grid.

Personally, I see Bootstraps' grid as the best grid out there. It is so diverse and allows a lot of different possibilities to the same layout at different breakpoints.

## Why?

Well we are already using ReactJS to write our HTML, so why not make the HTML we write look more specific to the component we want?

`<Container />` is a container.

`<Row />` is a row.

`<Column />` is a column.

## How to use

Take the copy the [build file](dist/build.js) into your project.

Use the elements how you would imagine - read docs below for more help!

- [Container](docs/container.md)
- [Row](docs/row.md)
- [Column](docs/column.md)
- [Block](docs/block.md)
